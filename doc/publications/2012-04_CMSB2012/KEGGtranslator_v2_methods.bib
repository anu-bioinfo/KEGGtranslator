	GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by GPML, a new XML file format
	that provides seamless exchange of graphical pathway information
	among multiple programs.PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics
	tools to open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological
	knowledge, interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets,
	and computational augmentation of pathways with interaction information.
	PathVisio is open source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.PathVisio
	is a graphical editor for biological pathways, with flexibility and

  abstract = {In past years, comprehensive representations of cell signalling pathways
	have been developed by manual curation from literature, which requires
	huge effort and would benefit from information stored in databases
	and from automatic retrieval and integration methods. Once a reconstruction
	of the network of interactions is achieved, analysis of its structural
	features and its dynamic behaviour can take place. Mathematical modelling
	techniques are used to simulate the complex behaviour of cell signalling
	networks, which ultimately sheds light on the mechanisms leading
	to complex diseases or helps in the identification of drug targets.
	A variety of databases containing information on cell signalling
	pathways have been developed in conjunction with methodologies to
	access and analyse the data. In principle, the scenario is prepared
	to make the most of this information for the analysis of the dynamics
	of signalling pathways. However, are the knowledge repositories of
	signalling pathways ready to realize the systems biology promise?
	In this article we aim to initiate this discussion and to provide
	some insights on this issue.},

  journal = {BMC Systems Biology},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {39},
  number = {1},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been
	facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations
	like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
	
	 Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via
	automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone
	and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For
	each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry,
	the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules)
	as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other
	modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions
	between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions.
	The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized
	mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based
	kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics
	allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction
	and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to
	one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
	After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and
	assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner
	or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported
	to SBML, \LaTeX or plain text format.
	
	 Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating
	reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for
	reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas
	are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance
	with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously
	published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators
	of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the
	information expressed through the process diagram. Additional material
	and the source code can be found at the project homepage (URL found
	in the Availability and requirements section).},

	emerged as a standard for storage, communication and interchange
	of models in systems biology. As a machine-readable format XML is
	difficult for humans to read and understand. Many tools are available
	that visualize the reaction pathways stored in SBML files, but many

	links to MIRIAM resources, are often not made visible in these diagrams.
	For a broader understanding of the models, support in scientific
	writing and error detection, a human-readable report of the complete
	model is needed. We present SBML2\LaTeX, a Java-based stand-alone

	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend.

	a variety of the most common FBA algorithms, including the first
	available implementation of (i) weighted flux minimization, (ii)
	fitness maximization for partially inhibited enzymes, and (iii) of

	for scientists nowadays. However, the diversity of the databases
	and the underlying data models make it difficult to combine this
	information for solving complex problems in systems biology. Currently,
	researchers typically have to browse several, often highly focused,
	databases to obtain the required information. Hence, there is a pressing
	need for more efficient systems for integrating, analyzing, and interpreting
	these data. The standardization and virtual consolidation of the
	databases is a major challenge resulting in a unified access to a
	variety of data sources.We present the Biochemical Network Database
	(BNDB), a powerful relational database platform, allowing a complete
	semantic integration of an extensive collection of external databases.
	BNDB is built upon a comprehensive and extensible object model called
	BioCore, which is powerful enough to model most known biochemical
	processes and at the same time easily extensible to be adapted to
	new biological concepts. Besides a web interface for the search and
	curation of the data, a Java-based viewer (BiNA) provides a powerful
	platform-independent visualization and navigation of the data. BiNA
	uses sophisticated graph layout algorithms for an interactive visualization
	and navigation of BNDB.BNDB allows a simple, unified access to a
	variety of external data sources. Its tight integration with the
	biochemical network library BN++ offers the possibility for import,
	integration, analysis, and visualization of the data. BNDB is freely
	accessible at http://www.bndb.org.},

	useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is

	However, the two most widespread used standards for storing pathway

	we introduce an approach for such integration based on a bridging
	format that we named systems biology pathway exchange (SBPAX) alluding
	to SBML and BioPAX. It facilitates conversion between data in different
	formats by a combination of one-to-one mappings to and from SBPAX

	provide a flexible description expanding around essential pathway
	data - basically the common subset of all formats describing processes,
	the substances participating in these processes and their locations.
	SBPAX can act as a repository for molecular interaction data from
	a variety of sources in different formats, and the information about
	their relative relationships, thus providing a platform for converting
	between formats and documenting assumptions used during conversion,
	gluing (identifying related elements across different formats) and

	predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity
	map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete

	in bioinformatics. Standards for representation of information about
	pathways are necessary for integration and analysis of data from
	various sources. Recently, a number of representation formats for
	pathway data, SBML, PSI MI and BioPAX, have been proposed. RESULTS:
	In this paper we compare these formats and evaluate them with respect
	to their underlying models, information content and possibilities
	for easy creation of tools. The evaluation shows that the main structure
	of the formats is similar. However, SBML is tuned towards simulation
	models of molecular pathways while PSI MI is more suitable for representing
	details about particular interactions and experiments. BioPAX is
	the most general and expressive of the formats. These differences
	are apparent in allowed information and the structure for representation
	of interactions. We discuss the impact of these differences both
	with respect to information content in existing databases and computational
	properties for import and analysis of data.},

	determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing

	transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction
	to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules
	manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline,
	or used individually during a manual curation process. This work
	describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which
	the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The
