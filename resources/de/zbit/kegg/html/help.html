    <h1>KEGGtranslator - Online Help</h1>
    
  <p><b>Short description:</b><br/>
Nowadays, the KEGG PATHWAY database provides a widely used service for pathway-based information. It contains manually drawn pathway maps with information about the genes, reactions and relations contained therein. To store these pathways, KEGG uses an own XML-format. Parsers and translators are needed to process the pathway maps for usage in other applications and algorithms.
<br/>
We have developed KEGGtranslator, which is an easy-to-use stand-alone application that can visualize and convert KGML formatted XML-files into multiple output formats. Unlike other translators, KEGGtranslator supports a plethora of output formats, is able to augment the information in translated documents (e.g., MIRIAM annotations) beyond the scope of the KGML document, and amends missing components to fragmentary reactions within the pathway to allow simulations on those.
KEGGtranslator converts KEGG files (KGML formatted XML-files) to SBML, GML, GraphML, JPG, GIF, LaTeX, etc.

You can find further information and help about this application at the KEGGtranslator homepage at http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/KEGGtranslator/

<p><b>Batch processing:</b><br/>
KEGGtranslator can be used to batch convert multiple KGML formatted XML-files. To use this feature, simply give a folder as input argument, together with the desired output format and optional additional options. For example,
<p class="typewriter-blue">
  java -jar KEGGtranslator.jar --input C:/ --format SBML
</p>
will convert all KEGG files, found on drive C (including subdirectories) to SBML files.
